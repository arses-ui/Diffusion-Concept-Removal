# CURE Improvements

Extensions of [CURE: Concept Unlearning via Orthogonal Representation Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12677) (Biswas, Roy, Roy — Purdue University).

This repo contains the original CURE implementation and two extensions that address its key limitations.

### `cure/` — Original Implementation

The base CURE method: training-free concept erasure for Stable Diffusion v1.4 via SVD of CLIP text embeddings and closed-form weight edits to cross-attention Wk/Wv. Erases a concept in ~2 seconds.

### `cure_seq/` — CURE-Sequential

**Problem:** Applying CURE sequentially to erase multiple concepts causes cross-term interference — earlier erasures degrade after ~50 concepts (Figure 6).

**Solution:** Orthogonalize each new concept's projector against all previously erased subspaces, guaranteeing `Pi @ Pj = 0` for all `i ≠ j`. Sequential edits compose cleanly with zero interference.

See [`cure_seq/README.md`](cure_seq/README.md) for details.

### `cure_dit/` — CURE-DiT

**Problem:** CURE only works on SD v1.4's UNet architecture. SD3 and Flux use MM-DiT (Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer) with joint attention — no cross-attention layers to target.

**Solution:** Identify the analogous text-stream projections (`add_k_proj`/`add_v_proj`) in SD3's `JointTransformerBlock` and apply CURE's spectral projection in the 1152-dim context space.

See [`cure_dit/README.md`](cure_dit/README.md) for details.

## Shared Evaluation Protocol

For cross-branch re-baselining with a unified config and JSON result schema, use:

```bash
python evaluation/run_shared_eval.py --branch cure --concept-set objects10
python evaluation/run_shared_eval.py --branch cure_seq --concept-set objects10 --erasure-mode sequential
python evaluation/run_shared_eval.py --branch cure_dit --concept-set objects10
```
